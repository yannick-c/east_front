`east_front.py` is a multiprocessed program which launches multiple East
processes and gives an average hitting time of the top-right corner (bulk
hitting time) and the hitting time of the top-left or bottom-right corner (axis
hitting times).

`east_front_plot.py` runs a single simulation and saves the state at given
intervals so either a movie can be made or a fitting image can be chosen.
